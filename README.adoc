This document provides all the required information for Cloudera Partners to setup a CDP Environment on Public Cloud. In addition to exploring different Data Services that run on containerized environment, this setup can also be used for any solution validation, certification, getting a Hands-on experience, or for any demos with potential customers. Here, you will get all the details for a quick-setup of a CDP environment on CDP Public Cloud with *AWS* as the provider for all the cloud resources. 

NOTE: Please note that this setup currently can only be run on Mac as the setup is done through a shell script. This will soon be dockerized so that you can run it on any platform. 

== Prerequisites

==== Access to a CDP tenant with PowerUser access

==== Access to the AWS account with administrator access.

==== AWS CLI

* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html[AWS CLI Installation Steps]

* Ensure you have aws cli configured in your PATH. Run the below command to confirm the same. You should get the version details of aws-cli. 

[.shell]
----
aws --version
----

==== CDP access key and private key

* On the CDP Portal, click at the left bottom corner and click on Profile as shown below.

* Click on Generate Access Key as shown below.

* Copy the values of Access Key ID and Secret Key separately and keep it in a note.

== Configure AWS CLI

* As part of the configuration, you will enter the aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key for your account/IAM role with *administrator* access. 

* Refer to the steps https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html[here] to create the access key id and secret key. 

* Once you have these values, run the below command.

[.shell]
----
aws configure
----

* It will prompt for the following values. 

** AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Enter the access key id>
** AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Enter the secret access key>
** Default region name [ap-south-1]: <Enter the region>
** Default output format [None]: json

* After entering these values, you will have two files created in .aws folder in your home directory(~/.aws). They are credentials and config. 

* In the *config* file, you will see a profile created with the region and output format. (Usually, this profile name is set to *default*.) 

* Make a note of this profile name. It needs to be entered in a parameters file later. 

* You can also modify both credentials and config file and keep a suitable name for the aws profile to be used later. 

== Steps to run the script

* Clone this repository with the below command. 
[.shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/pannagk/CDP_Public_Cloud_on_AWS.git
----

* Run the below commands. 
[.shell]
----
cd CDP_Public_Cloud_on_AWS
rm -rf images README.adoc
----

* Open the file setup_params.sh and update all the values. 

[.shell]
----
vi setup_params.sh
----

   1. prefix="Enter a unique value for prefix for identifying resources" (example:- cdp-poc-aws)   
   2. aws_region="Enter a valid aws region"
   3. cdp_run_time="Enter CDP Runtime version" (7.2.16 is the latest. You can check with your Cloudera POC to verify this. )
   4. cdp_access_key_id="Enter the CDP access key id here" #This value is generated in the Prerequisites step
   5. cdp_private_key="Enter the CDP private key here" #This value is generated in the Prerequisites step

* Run the script with the below command. Please note that this is an executable script and the extra x at the end in the script name is not a typo.
[.shell]
----
./cdp_setup_on_aws.sh.x
----

* The setup script executes the required steps for creation of CDP Environment in a sequence and you can see the output for each step. You can keep monitoring the logs of the script. If you encounter any error, take the screenshot or copy the error message and share it with the Cloudera POC you are working with. 

* Please note that the script has some wait commands and thus during the execution, you will see no logs being printed occasionally. *Do not end the script abruptly in such cases.*
